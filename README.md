# PeanutButter.TrayIcon

## What is it?
PeanutButter.TrayIcon provides a relatively easy way to create and use a Windows systray icon.

## Wasn't this in PeanutButter before?
Yes. Everything else in PeanutButter can build with the dotnet core build tools. This is the
only project requiring WinForms, and it's not regularly updated, simply because I don't have
changes I wish to make to it. This project is, however, supported -- bug reports and feature
requests made via the GitHub issue tracker will be attended to.
